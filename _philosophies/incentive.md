**Incentives.. Nothing else**

We are motivated by greed collectively as a human species.

We know destroying environment for material profit is bad in the long run but we do it anyway because that's profitable. Our survival instincts have given us a very short sighted ambition.

Anything driven by morals, ethics is far less likely to succeed compared to something driven by incentive.

Want to save environment?
Create a business model where the being of trees and forests creates more revenue than cutting them down. (People don't do anything out of altruism or even a lack of incentive, what's in it matters a lot)
