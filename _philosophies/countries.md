Human beings are the most territorial of the animals around.

May be we need countries. It's a practical problem of administration, safety, economics and so on.

But when does that emotion get over-attached to this concept of nation?

Do I love my country?
Not more than I love my people. My family, friends, neighbors and villagers. Those come first to me. In a way when I say I love my country basically what I am implying is that I love my people.

Do I hate any country?
No.
How can I love my own country if I can't love or respect another person's country. 


When soldiers fight at the border and die what is it they are actually dying or fighting for? For someone's ego? For someone's diplomatic inability? People living in the heartland in the safe and secure realm cheer for these soldiers but do those soldiers really want to fight. There's the exact same situation at the opposite side. If you are ready to have people killed then what it is that you have love for. Illusionary pride!!
