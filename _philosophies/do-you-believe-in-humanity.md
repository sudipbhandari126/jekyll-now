title: do you believe in humanity?

Now and then someone comes to news and limelight for doing some heroic deed, for helping someone in crisis and people start saying something in the line of 'my faith in humanity has been restored' or something.

Do you believe in humanity?

Do you believe in love?

I say stop asking these questions. These are stupid and meaningless questions.

My question to you is:

Have you ever helped someone in need without anything in return?

Have you ever truly loved someone? (Think this way: pick a person you really love in your life (parents, spouse, friend), Can you give that love to someone else too?)
