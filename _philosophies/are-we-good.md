>“We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behaviour.”
>― Stephen M.R. Covey, The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything


I love this quote. I think it perfectly sums of why the inherent good of people doesn't get to materialize often.

It's a loop. A never ending loop.

You sit and wonder if humanity exists, if true love exists, if altruism exists?
But you don't do those yourself. You don't love, you don't help. You just sit there and expect.

People are cautious and don't want to be harmed. So they end up harming one another because the other person is going to harm you anyway, why take a chance!! But hey it's fine your intentions were good
