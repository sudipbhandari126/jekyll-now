**Am I a passionate man?**

In conventional meaning, No.


I am not 'passionate' about anything. Most of the things I do as adult (programming, music) are the things I picked up after I was 20. Was I passionate about them from the beginning? No.

But I am a very passionate man towards life. I live my life with passion. (It's a vague abstract thing). Point being passion doesn't lie in the process or the 'things' that we do, be it sports, music, poetry, programming, business, dance, etc. Passion should be able to transcend all of these into something big.


Who is more passionate:: A guy who makes some awesome avant-garde music vs A guy who works at a bank 9 to 5?
Bank guy could be as passionate. Artist guy could be as 'passion-less'. Creating art is not passion, crunching numbers in the bank is not passion. Why do people do what they do? 

Bank guy gets off work goes home and has a nice meal with his family.
May be the artist guy is doing his art just to feed his ego or to chase 'fame/money' and nothing else.

Bank guy is much more passionate. May be the 9 to 5 is boring as fuck. But so are most of the things that we do in life. Do we do for the sake of 'things' or do we perform those just as the stage which can lead us to someplace we aim?
