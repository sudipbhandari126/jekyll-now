I know of a world famous singer who sang songs of the poor and now lives in a huge mansion, avoids paying taxes as much as possible, tries to milk money, has utter disregard towards the poor...

He has become what he once stood up against.

I went to a gig a month back. (A Metallica tribute show). It was highly crowded, lot of young people dressed in black t-shirt and jeans, most with long hairs and over-priced ticket (I know for a fact that the guys actually playing will end up getting a very small portion of the profit made). We all headbanged to the song, "Master of puppets". You see the irony of it?


What the fuck is art anyway?
Something that speaks in very very high volume of 'passion'? Another misleading thing? Is it an excuse to make a living, earn money and fame?


What's your favorite song?

Let me ask a better question actually. Name a song which you think is great. Why do you think so? (Name a painting/poem or anything that you think is great and apply the same logic) How do people even judge art ?


There are actually a very few art connoisseur. Most either search their place in the mass. Yeah beatles are great, mona lisa is great, this recent oscar movie is awesome, the lead actor was irreplaceable, blah blah  blah...

Some try to make their place in the offstream just with the motive to stand out from the rest. Beatles are overrated, mona lisa is nothing special.. blah blah blah...

I play a little music myself and have an ear to it (some sort of). But I have very few knowledge about paintings. Do I think mona lisa is great? I don't know
