title: is life just a utility?

Modern life focuses so much more on being productive.

Picture these:

- Sales guy or a manager at a urinal with one hand on dick and another on his smartphone (quick updates on mails, tweets)

-  Extreme consumption (thanks to modern smart electronics) You are glued to screen/earphones (or other interfaces) consuming news, podcasts, tweets

Is that the purpose of life, provided it has any in the first place?

Are we just agents programmed to accomplish some 'utility' whatever that is?


Modern life is fast, stupid, too much focused on consumption (material, information, entertainment) and has utter disregard to other things that make us human. What's inevitable is a series of crisis which leads to:

- people joining meditation (or other 'mindfulness' craps) in search of inner peace
- people joining fitness centres to attain well being 

To me it appears like despite the path of prevention modern life undergoes suffering (while trying to achieve that utility) and then goes for cure. The cure is again some sort of 'modern consumeristic approach'.

Uggh!!
