You look around and see beautiful flowers, beautiful landscapes and the miracle of millions of living creatures.

Nature must be so elegant. It's designed so perfectly. May be we humans can learn something from there. May be even there's some higher power (god) orchestrating all this.

No.

Nature is stupid. There is no elegance or 'good design'.

What we see today is the result of millions of years of trials and errors. It's purely random probability. No hidden intention or motive. Random events occur. Events bring about changes. Some changes lead to better surival (living beings) or stability (inanimate objects like mountains) and those remain. Others vanish.

Nature is not intelligent or thought out. 

It just evolves towards what benifits in the short term. In the bigger picture it might turn out to be an utterly stupid design:

- think about why we have same entry for oesophagus and lungs (how many people die of choking every year?) (may be this feature was so much benificial at one time, not any more)


Nature is full of awe. But we know it's not a thought out, laid out design.

Birds fly by flapping their wings.
Early attempts at building flying machines tried to emulate this but failed utterly.
Now we have  huge jets which fly on completely different principle.
