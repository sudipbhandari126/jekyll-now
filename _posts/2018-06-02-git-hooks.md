## Adding tag support to Jekyll Now 


I have added tags to all the blog posts. This particular plugin isn't supported by github so running it just like that doesn't create 'tags'. A workaround is to create tags locally (`jekyll serve` will do it) and then pushing those contents to the github repo.

I have added a small python script under `pre-commit` git-hook in order to automate this so that all of my posts and their tags are automatically added to my git staging area and subsequently pushed to github.


In order to use this git-hook, create a file `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and populate it with the following content and make it executable using `sudo chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`. (Used python instead of shell or perl for simplicity)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import shutil
import git
shutil.move('_site/tag','.')
repo = git.Repo('.')
repo.git.add('tag/')
```
