It’s fun as a developer when you get to integrate already existing powerful APIs into your own application. Google Maps API is the almost de-facto API used by location based applications and services. (car pooling, uber, ola, food delivery apps, etc). I recently integrated google maps reverse-geocoding functionality in the project that I am involved at.

I am serving this app over Django, which I have recently started using and it’s super awesome when you want to prototype and build things faster without worrying about minor details, convention over configuration FTW.
